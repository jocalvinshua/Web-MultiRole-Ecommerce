# 🛍️ Multi role Ecomerce Website Project

Fullstack E-Commerce Website for Small Businesses (UMKM)

A modern fullstack web application designed to help small and medium businesses (UMKM) manage products, orders, and customers efficiently.
Built with React, Supabase, and modern web best practices, this project demonstrates my ability to design scalable frontend architecture, manage authentication & authorization, and handle real-world product workflows.

## 🔐 Admin Access Flow

/admin
